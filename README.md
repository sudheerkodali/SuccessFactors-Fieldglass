      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
           name: "Sudheer",
           age: 34
      };

      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
      ```

      **Note:** This is an easiest way to create an object.
